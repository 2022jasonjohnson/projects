<h1> The Most Boring Website Possible </h1>
<hr>

<p> Welcome to the most boring page known to man.
  On this page, you'll be able to witness the void of neutral gray,
  with the complentary of generic black font. If your hobby is looking
  at paint dry on a fence, then this page is the most likely within your
  favor.
  <h2>Other than that, There is nothing here for you.</h2>
<br>
<embed>There is nothing here on this page --- at least there's nothing
  interesting here. I doubt you'd be intereseted in learning about nothing.
  If you are in fact interested, it wouldn't hurt to read a very boring essay.

<h2>The Most Boring Essay Possible</h2>
Gray skies. I like gray skies. The lightest shadow known to man.<br><br>
On gray days, there's nothing happening. No one is outside, so that means
nothing is going on outside your window. If no one is doing anything outside,
then that means any news broadcast would only talk about the weather.
"What's going on for today's weather?" Nothing, nothing at all. Thankfully,
it's not raining; you could possibly go outside. However, the floor is wet,
muddy, and overall depressing. What could you do on a day like this? Easily,
homework can suffice.<br><br>
What type of homework do you like to do? There's countless forms of homework
given out to kids, yet almost none of them seem interesting to them. Personally,
students should appreciate assignments given by their teachers. Essays typically
are the most favorable of them all. Nothing beats writing approximately 1,000
words on one particular topic for a grade that may make or break a letter grade.
Alas, anything relating to going outside would be foolish --- it's gray outside.
Perhaps a documentary on gray skies wouldn't be awful, except how could you make
that interesting? A documentary on gray skies alone would be bland, boring, a
document filled with nothing.
