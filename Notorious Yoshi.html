      Utterly fascinating! Why, I ought to be shaking in my silver boots! Who knew that a well-known creature like
      <br><br>y&nbsp;o&nbsp;s&nbsp;h&nbsp;i<br><br>
      would show up on such a short notice! Don't go anywhere,
       it's time to learn about <strong>Yoshi</strong>.

    <p><h2 style="color:Tomato;">This is Orange Yoshi.</h2></p>
    <p><em>This is strong text.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Height: 9 inches; Constantly growing at an alarming rate</li>
      <li>Weight: He's as big as it gets</li>
      <li>Appearance: Soft Polyester Fiber, striving with mainly orange,
        blue and white </li>
    </ul>

    <p> This glorifying specimen wasn't always considered peak masculinity.
    Before anything, he debuted in a workshop somewhere in China. His gains
  were weak. Him and his brethren all suffered from having "weak-peak syndrome",
 which is an illness that causes your potential to max at a low point. The only
colors "orange" Yoshi carried at the time was gray; he wasn't worthy of obtaining
his bright and fleshed out colors yet. </p>
<p> In the fall of October 2021, a light beamed down upon the prescence upon
  Yoshi; he was chosen among all the others. In a moment, his body became
  animated. His power grew greatly, as the light engolfed his body in color.
  And before you know it, Orange Yoshi truly came to be. A vision told him to
  travel to America to fufil his role as being the best plush a person can ever
  own. So with the power of Amazon, he traveled and traveled to meet his owner.
  And with that owner, he solely promised to remain idle, becoming the most optimalized
  plushie on the planet.
