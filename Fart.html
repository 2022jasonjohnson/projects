<h1 class="background-color2">Welcome To The Offical Website of <br>
Farty Mc Shmarty</h1>

  <body>

    <p class="italic">By honouring McShmarty, we have decided<br>
       to retrieve his long-lost poem from the year 6969 and show
        case to the public. In order to interpret his poem, we ask
        readers to read this on either a toilet, inside a church, or
         most preferably right next to your mother. Respectfully, we follow
this suggestion because Farty McShmarty directed us to. <br><br>
And of course, enjoy.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2 class="background-color2"> Internal Meaning</h2>
  <br>
  <p> For a good portion of his life, McShmarty spent years of his life<br>
    using a bathroom as a thinking space; anything and everything he thinks about<br>
    comes straight from the shitter. His wife assumed that when he first met him,<br>
    she thought he was 'constipated'. His wedding day was spent not only down the hall,<br>
    but down the hall--- to the bathroom. Even now, his family: 3 kids and a dog,<br>
    question his bathroom wherabouts. It's resulted in several arguments to the point<br>
    where Ms. McShmarty claims he's "nothing without a damn toilet seat"; pitiful.<br>
    <br><br>
Despite the toilet being his disadvantage, it's one of the reasons why he owns<br>
such a beautiful house. With that in mind, his vision comes to life: life is<br><br>
  shit.
  <br><br>
  But, life comes in many forms of shit: the struggle, the loose<br>
  -and-easy one, the sloppy and runny, and of course the satisfying poop. It's<br>
  like a play on with words, especially when his poem is shaped like fecal matter.
