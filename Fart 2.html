<p> Fart McShmarty spent years of his life<br>
  using a bathroom as a thinking space; anything and everything he thinks about<br>
  comes straight from the shitter. His wife assumed that when he first met him,<br>
  she thought he was 'constipated'. His wedding day was spent not only down the hall,<br>
  but down the hall--- to the bathroom. Even now, his family: 3 kids and a dog,<br>
  question his bathroom wherabouts. It's resulted in several arguments to the point<br>
  where Ms. McShmarty claims he's "nothing without a damn toilet seat"; pitiful.<br>
  <br>
  As a child, he always spent his childhood in the toilet. He often said nothing<br>
  in his classes, but whenever he sat in a public toilet, he often impressed his<br>
  peers with pyscological statements that enlighten people. Teachers were also inspired,<br>
  especially when someone as young is capable of embracing a complex vocabulary.<br>
  Farty had a chance to excell and reach several top-performing classes, but the<br>
  only thing that held him back was the reason how he was able to deliver such inteligence.<br>
  <br>
  It was almost unbelieveable. It was almost unbelieveable when he managed to find<br>
  love interest. In a public unisex bathroom, McFarty delivered very notable opinions<br>
  on sandwiches. It wasn't his strongest day in the toilet, but it was just enough to<br>
  attract Francine (McShmarty). She overheard his ramlbing while her bladder rumbled peak.<br>
  The rest was history. Ironically though, he hasn't changed a bit. You could say that Francine<br>
  is still living with the past, whether she likes it or not.<p> </body>
